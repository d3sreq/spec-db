</P>
<H1>UC 8 - Product Exchange (on low stock) Among Stores</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Brief Description</H2>
<P>If a store runs out of a certain product
(or a set of products; required good), it is
possible to start a query to check whether those products
are available at other Stores of the Enterprise
(providing Stores). Therefore the Enterprise
Server and the Store Servers need to
synchronize their data on demand (one scheduled update per day or per
hour is not sufficient). After a successful query the critical
product can be shipped from one to other
Stores. But it has to be decided (using
heuristics to compute the future selling
frequency), whether the transportation is meaningful. For
example, if the product is propably sold out
at all Stores within the same day, a
transportation does not make sense.</P>
<P>Expressed in a more technical way one Store
Server is able to start a query at the Enterprise
Server. The Enterprise Server in
turn starts a query for products available at
other Stores. As the Enterprise
Server does not have the current global data for Stores
at any time (due to a write caching latency at the Store
Server) the Enterprise Server has
to trigger all Store Servers to push their
local data to the Enterprise Server. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Involved Actors</H2>
<P>This use case is not an end-user use case. Only servers are
involved.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Precondition</H2>
<P>The Store Server with the shortage
product is able to connect to the Enterprise
Server.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Trigger</H2>
<P>This use case is triggered by the system
itself.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Postcondition</H2>
<P>The products to deliver are marked as
incoming or unavailable, respectively, in the according Stores.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Standard Process</H2>
<P>1. A certain product of the Store
runs out.</P>
<P>2. The Store Server recognizes low
stock of the product. 
</P>
<P>3. The Store Server sends a request to
the Enterprise Server (including an
identification of the shortage products, and a
Store id) 
</P>
<P>4. The Enterprise Server triggers
all Stores that are near by (e. g. 300 km) the
requiring store, to flush their local write
caches. So the Enterprise Server
database gets updated by the Store Server.
</P>
<P>5. The Enterprise Server does a
database look-up for the required products to
get a list of products (including amounts)
that are available at providing Stores. 
</P>
<P>6. The Enterprise Server applies
the optimization criterion (specified above) to decide, whether it is
meaningful to transport the shortage product
from one store to another (heuristics might be
applied to minimize the total costs of transportation). This results
in a list of products (including amounts)
per providing store that have to be delivered to
the requiring Store. 
</P>
<P>7. The Store Server, initially sending
the recognition of the shortage product, is
provided with the decision of the Enterprise
Server. 
</P>
<P>The required product is marked as incoming.
</P>
<P>8. The Store Server of a near by Store
is provided with information that it has to deliver the product.
</P>
<P>The required product is marked as
unavailable in the Store. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Alternative or Exceptional Processes</H2>
<P>The Enterprise Server is not
available: The request is queued until the Enterprise
Server is available and then is send again.</P>
<P>One or more Store Servers are not
available: The Enterprise Server
queues the requests for the Store Servers
until they are available and then resend them. If a Store
Server is not available for more than 15 minutes the request for
this Server is canceled. It is assumed,
that finally unavailable Store Servers do
not have the required product.</P>
<H1>Extension on use case 8 - Remove Incoming Status</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Brief Description</H2>
<P>If the first part of use case 8 (as described above) has passed,
for moved products an amount
marked as incoming remains at the Inventory
of the Store receiving the products.
An extension allows to change that incoming mark via a user interface
at the Store Client if the moved products
arrive at a Store.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Precondition</H2>
<P>The Inventory is available and the Store
Client has been started.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Trigger</H2>
<P>The moved products (according to UC8)
arrive at the Store.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Postcondition</H2>
<P>For the amount of incoming products
the status incoming is removed in the Inventory.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Standard Process</H2>
<P>1. The products arrive at the stock
of the Store.</P>
<P>2. For all arriving products the Stock
Manager counts the incoming amount.</P>
<P>3. For every arriving product the Stock
Manager enters the identifier
and its amount into the Store
Client.</P>
<P>4. The System updates the Inventory.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Alternative or Exceptional Processes</H2>
<P>If the entered amount of an incoming
product is larger than the amount
accounted in the Inventory, the input is
rejected. The incoming amount has to be
reentered.</P>
