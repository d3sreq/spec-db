<H1 CLASS="western">Library System Specification</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">1. Objective</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Some Media and user
of a library are managed by the library
system. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">2. Operational Area</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The library system is
operated by the library staff (librarian)
and library user (user)
through terminals. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">3. Product overview</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The library system contains
a user administration and a media
administration. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">3.1 User administration</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The user
administration contains a user account
for each user which contains all user
data. A librarian is able to create a
new user account, to edit and to delete an
existing user account. A user
is able to register at the system with his
user number, to manage his
user account, and to extend the media's
rental period. A password is not necessary because the user
number on the identification card
is read with a bar code scanner. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">3.2 Media
administration</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The media
administration contains an entry for each medium
in the library. Several instances
of each medium may be available, and they may
have different locations. A
librarian is able to add a new media
instance to the media
administration, change the status
of an instance and remove
an instance from the media
administration. A user is able to search
for a medium by specifying one or more features of the media.
User can choose and reserve
a found instance. To this end, the user
number on the identification card
is scanned. If a user
borrows an instance, it is
added to his account and will only be
deleted when
it is returned. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">4. Product function</H2>
<P CLASS="western">A user account must be
available for each user. A librarian
has access to all accounts of all users.
A user has only access to his own user
account by using his user
number.
