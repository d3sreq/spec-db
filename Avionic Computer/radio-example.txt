					===================
					Radio Specification
					===================


This specification describes the requirements for controlling
the communication radio with the avionic computer (BC).
The next picture shows the connection of the radio to other
equipments over the bus system. 


					=======================
					Interface Specification
					=======================

Referenced Documents:
	* MMI concept for the display on the TA
	* Bus Interface description
	* MMI interface description 

Explication of the used messages:
The interface are used in the specification as followed:
	* Signal is sent from R1 to the BC  => R1BC_[Name]
	* Signal is sent from BC to R1 => BCR1_[Name]
	* The detail specification of the interface and the display
	  can be found in the databases. In the specification only
	  the names of the signal in the messages are referenced.

Interface definition of the TA:
The messages covers the messages from the TA to the BA and vice versa. 
The radio has three pages, white which the radio can be controlled.
All the pages can be reached by direct access keys. The name of the
keys are written recursive.

					====================
					Function description
					====================

This specification describes the control functions, which have to be
implemented on the BC. The radio has interactions over the BC to the MA and the TA.

The essential functions of the radio are the following:
	1. With the AT you can switch On / Off the broadcast and receiving unit
	2. With the TA  you can set the frequency 
	3. The AT show the status of the radio
	4. With the TA the preset frequency can be read out and written to the MA 


Read and write the MA
------------------------------------------------

Description:
The user can load the preset list of frequency into the BA with the TA.
After changing the list of frequency during operation the list can be
stored into the MA with the TA.

Req_1: Read MA
When the BC get the command  ATBC_Radio1_Demand_ReadPresetFrequency from
the TA, the BC shall start with BCMS_Radio1DemandReadData  the loading
of the data in the BC.  For every 20 msec read the content of the message
MSBC_Radio1Frequenz. When the MSBC_Radio1AckowledgeDataSent set to TRUE
the loading is be finished. The time out for MSBC_Radio1AckowledgeDataSent
is 30 seconds.

Req_2: Write MA
When the BC get the command  ATBC_Radio1_Demand_SavePresetFrequency from
the TA, the BC shall start with BCMS_Radio1DemandSaveData  the loading of
the data in the MC.  For every 20 msec read the content of the message
BCMS_Radio1Frequency. When the MSBC_Radio1AckkowledgeDataSave set to TRUE
the loading is be finished. The time out for MSBC_Radio1AckkowledgeDataSave
is 30 seconds.


Administration of the frequency in the computer
------------------------------------------------

Description:
The frequency list is administrated in the BC. In the list the user can scroll
up and down with the help of the TA. No entries can be deleted or modified
in the list.

Req_3: Display of the list entries
When the BC gets the command ATBC_Radio1_Display_Frequency,
the list entries shall be displayed on TA (BCAT_Radio1_List).
If no list entries in the BC dots shall be displayed.

Req_4: Select list entries
With the command ATBC_RADIO1_Select_Entry a list entry
shall be selected.

Req_5: Scroll up in the list
When the BC gets the command ATBC_Radio1_Srcoll_Up_Or_Down [UP],
on the TA (BCAT_Radio1_List) it shall be possible to scroll up
element wise  in the list. The scrolling shall stop at the first
element in the list.

Req_6: Scroll down in the list
When the BC gets the command ATBC_Radio1_Srcoll_Up_Or_Down [DOWN],
on the TA (BCAT_Radio1_List) it shall be possible to scroll down
element wise in the list. The scrolling shall stop at the last
element.


Radio Controlling:
------------------------------------------------

Description:
The BC shall control the radio with the TA. The BC can switch off
and on the broadcast and receiving unit and can set the frequency
of the radio.

Req_7: Switch Radio off and on
When the BC gets the command ATBC_Radio1_Demand_Switch_Power_OFF_ON,
the BC shall set the radio to on or off with the message
BCR1_Demand_To_Radio1_Switch_Power_OFF_ON.  The radio acknowledge
the command with R1BC_Acknowledge_Switch_Power_OFF_ON_Radio1.
The time out for the command are 2s.

Req_8: selecting a frequency for the radio
When the BC gets the command ATBC_RADIO1_Select_Entry, the BC shall
set the frequency with BCR1_Demand_To_Radio1_Change_Frequency.
The radio acknowledge the command with
R1BC_Ackknowledge_Change_Frequency_Radio1.
The time out for the command are 2 s.


Display:
------------------------------------------------

Description:
All display are updated cyclically rate 0,05 sec.

Req_9: display radio ON/OFF
R1BC_Ackknowledge_Change_Frequency_Radio1 shall be displayed
on the TA with BCAT_Radio1ONOFFDisplay 

Req_10: Display frequency
R1BC_Acknowledge_Switch_Power_OFF_ON_Radio1 shall be display
on the TA with BCAT_Radio1FrequencyDisplay

Req_11: Display BIT status
BCR1_BitteststatusRadio1 shall be displayed on the TA
with BCAT_Radio1BITTestDisplay.
