<H1>Use Cases for Example ATM System</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">System Startup Use Case</H2>
<P>The system is started up when the operator
turns the operator switch
to the &quot;on&quot; position.
The operator will be asked to enter the
amount of money currently in
the cash dispenser, and a connection to the
bank will be established. Then the servicing of
customers can begin.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">System Shutdown Use Case</H2>
<P>The system is shut down when the operator
makes sure that no customer is using the
machine, and then turns the operator
switch to the &quot;off&quot; position.
The connection to the bank will
be shut down. Then the operator is free to
remove deposited envelopes, replenish cash
and paper, etc.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Session Use Case</H2>
<P>A session is started when a customer
inserts an ATM card into the card
reader slot of the machine. The ATM
pulls the card into the machine
and reads it. (If the reader cannot read the
card due to improper insertion or a damaged
stripe, the card is ejected, an error screen is
displayed, and the session is aborted.) The
customer is asked to enter his PIN,
and is then allowed to perform one or more transactions,
choosing from a menu of possible types of transaction
in each case. After each transaction, the
customer is asked whether he would like to
perform another transaction. When the
customer is through performing transactions,
the card is ejected from the machine
and the session ends. If a transaction
is aborted due to too many invalid PIN
entries, the session is also aborted, with the
card being retained in the machine.</P>
<P>The customer may abort the session
by pressing the Cancel key when
entering a PIN or choosing a transaction
type.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Transaction Use Case</H2>
<P><EM>Note: Transaction is an abstract
generalization. Each specific concrete type of transaction
implements certain operations in the appropriate way. The flow of
events given here describes the behavior common to all types of
transaction. The flows of events for the
individual types of transaction
(withdrawal, deposit,
transfer, inquiry)
give the features that are specific to that type of transaction.</EM></P>
<P>A transaction use case is started
within a session when the customer
chooses a transaction type from a menu of
options. The customer will be asked to
furnish appropriate details (e.g. account(s)
involved, amount). The transaction
will then be sent to the bank, along with
information from the customer's card and the PIN
the customer entered.</P>
<P>If the bank approves the transaction,
any steps needed to complete the transaction
(e.g. dispensing cash or accepting an envelope)
will be performed, and then a receipt will be
printed. Then the customer will be asked
whether he wishes to do another transaction.</P>
<P>If the bank reports that the customer's
PIN is invalid, the Invalid PIN extension
will be performed and then an attempt will be made to continue the
transaction. If the customer's
card is retained due to too many invalid PINs,
the transaction will be aborted, and the
customer will not be offered the option of
doing another transaction.</P>
<P>If a transaction is cancelled by the
customer, or fails for any reason other than
repeated entries of an invalid PIN, a screen
will be displayed informing the customer of
the reason for the failure of the transaction,
and then the customer will be offered the
opportunity to do another transaction.</P>
<P>The customer may cancel a transaction
by pressing the Cancel key as
described for each individual type of transaction
below.</P>
<P>All messages to the bank
and responses back are recorded in the ATM's
log.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Withdrawal Transaction Use Case</H2>
<P>A withdrawal transaction asks the
customer to choose a type of account
to withdraw from (e.g. checking) from a menu of possible accounts,
and to choose a dollar amount from
a menu of possible amounts. The
system verifies that it has sufficient money on
hand to satisfy the request before sending the transaction
to the bank. (If not, the customer
is informed and asked to enter a different amount.)
If the transaction is approved by the
bank, the appropriate amount
of cash is dispensed by the machine before it
issues a receipt. (The dispensing of cash is
also recorded in the ATM's log.)</P>
<P>A withdrawal transaction can be
cancelled by the customer pressing the Cancel
key any time prior to choosing the dollar amount.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Deposit Transaction Use Case</H2>
<P>A deposit transaction asks the customer
to choose a type of account to deposit to
(e.g. checking) from a menu of possible accounts,
and to type in a dollar amount on
the keyboard. The transaction
is initially sent to the bank to verify that the
ATM can accept a deposit from this customer
to this account. If the transaction
is approved, the machine accepts an envelope
from the customer containing cash and checks
before it issues a receipt. Once the envelope
has been received, a second message is sent to
the bank, to confirm that the bank
can credit the customer's account - contingent
on manual verification of the deposit envelope
contents by an operator later. (The receipt
of an envelope is also recorded in the ATM's
log.)</P>
<P>A deposit transaction can be cancelled by
the customer pressing the Cancel
key any time prior to inserting the envelope
containing the deposit. The transaction is
automatically cancelled if the customer fails
to insert the envelope containing the deposit
within a reasonable period of time after being asked to do so.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Transfer Transaction Use Case</H2>
<P>A transfer transaction asks the customer
to choose a type of account to transfer from
(e.g. checking) from a menu of possible accounts,
to choose a different account to transfer to,
and to type in a dollar amount on
the keyboard. No further action is required
once the transaction is approved by the
bank before printing the receipt.</P>
<P>A transfer transaction can be cancelled by
the customer pressing the Cancel
key any time prior to entering a dollar amount.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Inquiry Transaction Use Case</H2>
<P>An inquiry transaction asks the customer
to choose a type of account to inquire about
from a menu of possible accounts. No further
action is required once the transaction is
approved by the bank before printing the receipt.</P>
<P>An inquiry transaction can be cancelled by
the customer pressing the Cancel
key any time prior to choosing the account
to inquire about.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Invalid PIN Extension</H2>
<P>An invalid PIN extension is started from within a transaction
when the bank reports that the customer's
transaction is disapproved due to an invalid PIN.
The customer is required to reenter the PIN
and the original request is sent to the bank
again. If the bank now approves the transaction,
or disapproves it for some other reason, the original use case is
continued; otherwise the process of reentering the PIN
is repeated. Once the PIN is successfully
reentered, it is used for both the current
transaction and all subsequent transactions
in the session. If the customer
fails three times to enter the correct PIN,
the card is permanently retained, a screen is
displayed informing the customer of this and
suggesting he contact the bank, and the entire
customer session is aborted.</P>
<P>If the customer presses Cancel
instead of reentering a PIN, the original
transaction is cancelled.</P>
