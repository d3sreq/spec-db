<H1>Requirements Statement for Example ATM System</H1>
<P>The software to be designed will control a simulated automated
teller machine (ATM) having a magnetic
stripe reader for reading an ATM card, a
customer console (keyboard and display)
for interaction with the customer, a slot for
depositing envelopes, a dispenser
for cash (in multiples of $20), a printer
for printing customer receipts, and a
key-operated switch to allow an operator
to start or stop the machine. The ATM
will communicate with the bank's computer over an
appropriate communication link. (The software on the latter is not
part of the requirements for this problem.)</P>
<P>The ATM will service one customer
at a time. A customer will be required to
insert an ATM card and enter a personal
identification number (PIN) - both of which
will be sent to the bank for validation as part
of each transaction. The customer
will then be able to perform one or more transactions.
The card will be retained in the machine
until the customer indicates that he desires
no further transactions, at which point it
will be returned - except as noted below.</P>
<P>The ATM must be able to provide the following
services to the customer:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>A customer must be able to make a
	cash withdrawal from any suitable account
	linked to the card, in multiples of $20.00.
	Approval must be obtained from the bank before
	cash is dispensed.</P>
	<LI><P>A customer must be able to make
	a deposit to any account linked to the
	card, consisting of cash and checks in an
	envelope. The customer
	will enter the amount of the
	deposit into the ATM, subject to manual
	verification when the envelope is removed
	from the machine by an operator.
	Approval must be obtained from the bank before
	physically accepting the envelope.</P>
	<LI><P>A customer must be able to make a
	transfer of money between any two accounts
	linked to the card.</P>
	<LI><P>A customer must be able to make a
	balance inquiry of any account
	linked to the card.</P>
</OL>
<P>A customer must be able to abort a
transaction in progress by pressing the
Cancel key instead of responding to
a request from the machine.</P>
<P>The ATM will communicate each transaction
to the bank and obtain verification that it was
allowed by the bank. Ordinarily, a transaction
will be considered complete by the bank once it
has been approved. In the case of a deposit, a
second message will be sent to the bank
indicating that the customer has deposited
the envelope. (If the customer
fails to deposit the envelope within the
timeout period, or presses cancel
instead, no second message will be sent to the
bank and the deposit will not be credited to the
customer.)</P>
<P>If the bank determines that the customer's
PIN is invalid, the customer will be
required to reenter the PIN before a
transaction can proceed. If the customer
is unable to successfully enter the PIN after
three tries, the card will be permanently
retained by the machine, and the customer
will have to contact the bank to get it back.</P>
<P>If a transaction fails for any reason
other than an invalid PIN, the ATM
will display an explanation of the problem, and will then ask the
customer whether he wants to do another
transaction.</P>
<P>The ATM will provide the customer
with a printed receipt for each successful transaction,
showing the date, time, machine location,
type of transaction, account,
amount, and ending and available
balance of the affected account (&quot;to&quot;
account for transfers).</P>
<P>The ATM will have a key-operated
switch that will allow an operator to
start and stop the servicing of customers.
After turning the switch to the &quot;on&quot;
position, the operator
will be required to verify and enter the total
cash on hand. The machine can only be turned
off when it is not servicing a customer. When
the switch is moved to the &quot;off&quot;
position, the machine
will shut down, so that the operator may
remove deposit envelopes and reload the
machine with cash, blank receipts, etc.</P>
<P>The ATM will also maintain an internal
log of transactions to facilitate
resolving ambiguities arising from a hardware failure in the middle
of a transaction. Entries will be made in
the log when the ATM is started
up and shut down, for each message sent to the
Bank (along with the response
back, if one is expected), for the dispensing of cash, and for the
receiving of an envelope. Log entries may
contain card numbers and dollar amounts, but for security will <EM>never
</EM>contain a PIN.</P>
