and User Interface for a Simple Address Book</SPAN></FONT></H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Requirements Statement</H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
software to be designed is a program that can be used to maintain an
address book. An address book holds a collection of entries, each
recording a person's first and last names, address, city, state, zip,
and phone number.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>It
must be possible to add a new person to an address book, to edit
existing information about a person (except the person's name), and
to delete a person. It must be possible to sort the entries in the
address book alphabetically by last name (with ties broken by first
name if necessary), or by ZIP code (with ties broken by name if
necessary). It must be possible to print out all the entries in the
address book in &quot;mailing label&quot; format.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>It
must be possible to create a new address book, to open a disk file
containing an existing address book to close an address book, and to
save an address book to a disk file, using standard New, Open, Close,
Save and Save As ... File menu options. The program's File menu will
also have a Quit option to allow closing all open address books and
terminating the program.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
initial requirements call for the program to only be able to work
with a single address book at a time; therefore, if the user chooses
the New or Open menu option, any current address book will be closed
before creating/opening a new one. A later extension might allow for
multiple address books to be open, each with its own window which can
be closed separately, with closing the last open window resulting in
terminating the program. In this case, New and Open will result in
creating a new window, without affecting the current window.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
program will keep track of whether any changes have been made to an
address book since it was last saved, and will offer the user the
opportunity to save changes when an address book is closed either
explicitly or as a result of choosing to create/open another or to
quit the program.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
program will keep track of the file that the current address book was
read from or most recently saved to, will display the file's name as
the title of the main window, and will use that file when executing
the Save option. When a New address book is initially created, its
window will be titled &quot;Untitled&quot;, and a Save operation will
be converted to Save As ... - i.e. the user will be required to
specify a file.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">User
Interface</SPAN></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>Because
this is to be a &quot;standard GUI&quot; style application, some
attention needs to be given to the user interface at this point. A
user interface like the following might be adopted. Not shown in the
screen shot is a File menu with New, Open, Close, Save, Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;...,
Print, and Quit options. For the &quot;Edit&quot; and &quot;Delete&quot;
buttons, the user must first select a person in the scrolling list of
names, and then can click the appropriate button to edit/delete that
person.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
