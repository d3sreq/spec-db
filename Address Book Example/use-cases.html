<H2 CLASS="western">Add a Person Use Case</H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
Add a Person use case is initiated when the user clicks the &quot;Add&quot;
button in the main window. A dialog box appears, with title &quot;New
Person&quot;, containing fields for the user to fill in the new
person's first and last names and other information. The box can be
dismissed by clicking either &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot;. If
the &quot;OK&quot; button is clicked, a new person is added to the
end of the address book, and the person's name is added to the end of
the list of names in the main window. If the &quot;Cancel&quot;
button is clicked, no changes are made either to the address book or
to the main window.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
Edit a Person use case is initiated when the user either highlights a
name in the list of names in the main window and then clicks the
&quot;Edit&quot; button, or the user double-clicks a name. In either
case, a dialog box, with title &quot;Edit person's name&quot;,
appears containing current information about the person selected,
(except the person's name, which appears only in the title). The user
can then edit the individual fields. The box can be dismissed by
clicking either &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot;. If the &quot;OK&quot;
button is clicked, the entry in the address book for the selected
person is updated to reflect any changes made by the user. If the
&quot;Cancel&quot; button is clicked, no changes are made to the
address book.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

in the list of names in the main window and then clicks the &quot;Delete&quot;
button. A dialog box appears, asking the user to confirm deleting
this particular individual. The box can be dismissed by clicking
either &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot;. If the &quot;OK&quot;
button is clicked, the entry in the address book for the selected
person is deleted, and the person's name is deleted from the list of

clicked, no changes are made either to the address book or to the
main window.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The

<H2 CLASS="western">Print Entries Use Case</H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
Print Entries use case is initiated when the user chooses &quot;Print&quot;
from the File menu. A save file dialog is displayed, and the user is
allowed to choose a file to print the labels to. (If the user cancels
the file dialog, the Print operation is canceled.) The current
contents of the address book are written out to the specified file
(in their current order) in &quot;mailing label&quot; format. No
information maintained by the program is changed.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Create New Address Book Use Case</H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
Create a New Address Book use case is initiated when the user chooses
&quot;New&quot; from the File menu. If the current address book
contents have been changed since the last successful New, Open, Save,
or Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... operation was done, the Offer to Save
Changes extension is executed. Unless the user cancels the operation,
a new empty address book is then created and replaces the current
address book. This results in the list of names in the main window
being cleared, the current file becoming undefined, and the title of
the main window becomes &quot;Untitled&quot;. (NOTE: These conditions
will also be in effect when the program initially starts up.)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Open Existing Address Book Use Case</H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
Open Existing Address Book use case is initiated when the user
chooses &quot;Open&quot; from the File menu. If the current address
book contents have been changed since the last successful New, Open,
Save, or Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... operation was done, the Offer to Save
Changes extension is executed. Unless the user cancels the operation,
a load file dialog is displayed and the user is allowed to choose a
file to open. Once the user chooses a file, the current address book
is replaced by the result of reading in the specified address book.
This results in the list of names in the main window being replaced
by the names in the address book that was read, the file that was
opened becoming the current file, and its name being displayed as the
title of the main window. (If the user cancels the file dialog, or
attempting to read the file results in an error, the current address
book is left unchanged. If the cancellation results from an error
reading the file, a dialog box is displayed warning the user of the
error.)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... option is always available.) A save file dialog
is displayed and the user is allowed to choose the name of a file in
which to save the address book. (If the user cancels the file dialog,
the Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... operation is canceled.) The current address
book is saved to the specified file, and the file to which it was
saved becomes the current file and its name is displayed as the title
of the main window. (If attempting to write the file results in an
error, a dialog box is displayed warning the user of the error, and
the current file and main window title are unchanged.) In all cases,
the current address book and window list are left unchanged.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Quit Program Use Case</H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4>The
Quit Program use case is initiated when the user chooses &quot;Quit&quot;
from the File menu, or clicks the close box for the main window. In
either case, if the current address book contents have been changed
since the last New, Open, Save, or Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... operation
was done, the Offer to Save Changes extension is executed. Unless the

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">The
Offer to Save Changes extension is initiated from within the Create
New Address Book, Open Existing Address Book, or Quit program use
cases, if the current address book has been changed since the last
successful New, Open, Save, or Save&nbsp;As&nbsp;... operation was
done. A dialog box is displayed, informing the user that there are
unsaved changes, and asking the user whether to save changes, not
save changes, or cancel the operation. If the user chooses to save
changes, the Save Address Book Use Case is executed (which may result
in executing the Save Address Book As ... Use Case if there is no
current file). If the user chooses not to save changes, the original
operation is simply resumed. If the user chooses to cancel (or
cancels the save file dialog if one is needed), the original
operation is canceled.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
